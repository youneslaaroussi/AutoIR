Good afternoon. If you have ever watched an on‑call engineer scroll through a wall of logs at two in the morning, you know the moment when the team senses a pattern but cannot quite put a name to it; AutoIR compresses that uncertainty to seconds by turning raw logs into a searchable memory and drafting a clear, evidence‑backed incident you can act on immediately.

A quick story to anchor this. In a checkout service pilot, intermittent “card declined” messages hid a surge of upstream rate‑limit errors; exact‑match filters split the evidence across streams, so every query told a partial truth. With AutoIR, we searched for “throttling on checkout,” and, while the results come in—give it a second—the system grouped the variants, ranked them by similarity and freshness, and proposed an incident titled “Checkout throttling at payments gateway,” marked high severity with strong confidence, and suggested two concrete steps: raise limits and verify retry behavior. Engineers clicked into the cited lines, validated in under a minute, and moved straight to mitigation; over the week, time to triage dropped on the order of forty percent, with noticeably fewer handoffs.

Under the hood, the choices are deliberately conservative so this fits real organizations. We tail CloudWatch logs, generate a compact vector for each message using a managed inference endpoint, and store those vectors in TiDB so search and data live together with mature operational tooling. Semantic search means you query by meaning rather than exact phrasing, so “timeout after 30s” and “backend exceeded time budget” sit side by side. The analysis loop looks at recent activity, samples likely trouble spots, and asks a language model to assemble a disciplined incident—title, severity, confidence, a one‑paragraph summary, and a couple of next actions—with citations back to the original lines. We enforce structured output and attach those citations, so reviewers can verify quickly and avoid speculative summaries. On first run we do a quick bootstrap of connections and endpoint health—give it a moment—and then everything stays warm.

For the business, the impact is straightforward. Faster detection because the system proposes incidents instead of waiting for someone to notice; faster diagnosis because similar symptoms collapse into one narrative; better coordination because the next steps are concrete and the evidence is attached. Costs stay predictable through batching, sampling, and tight time windows; operations run in your cloud account, data stays in your network, transport is encrypted, and access follows the same permissions model you already use. The reason this is feasible now is that mainstream databases provide efficient vector search and managed inference is stable at practical price points, so you can add this capability without a platform rewrite.

Our ask is simple: let us stand up a focused pilot this afternoon against one high‑value log group, set a one‑week success measure around time to triage, and review the results together next Friday. AutoIR turns log noise into incidents with receipts, which makes nights quieter, post‑mortems cleaner, and the business impact smaller. Thank you.
